<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">ExxonMobil's the world's largest publicly traded company when measured by revenue. Exxon Mobil's reserves were 72 bil-lion oil-equivalent barrels at the end of 2007 and, at current rates of production, are expected to last over 14 years. The com-pany has 38 oil refineries in 21 countries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 6.3 million barrels. </FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><B>History</B></FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Exxon Mobil Corporation was formed in 1999 by the merger of two major oil companies, Exxon and Mobil. Both Exxon and Mobil were descendants of the John D. Rockefeller corporation, Standard Oil which was established in 1870. The reputation of Standard Oil in the public eye suffered badly after publication of Ida M. Tarbell's classic expos&eacute; The History of the Standard Oil Company in 1904, leading to a growing outcry for the government to take action against the company.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">By 1911, with public outcry at a climax, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Standard Oil must be dissolved and split into 34 companies. Two of these companies were Jersey Standard (&quot;Standard Oil Company of New Jersey&quot;), which eventually became Exxon, and Socony (&quot;Standard Oil Company of New York&quot;), which eventually became Mobil.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In the same year, the nation's kerosene output was eclipsed for the first time by gasoline. The growing automotive market in-spired the product trademark Mobiloil, registered by Socony in 1920.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Over the next few decades, both companies grew significantly. Jersey Standard, led by Walter C. Teagle, became the larg-est oil producer in the world. It acquired a 50 percent share in Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., a Texas oil producer. Socony pur-chased a 45 percent interest in Magnolia Petroleum Co., a major refiner, marketer and pipeline transporter. In 1931, Socony merged with Vacuum Oil Co., an industry pioneer dating back to 1866 and a growing Standard Oil spin-off in its own right.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In the Asia-Pacific region, Jersey Standard had oil production and refineries in Indonesia but no marketing network. Socony-Vacuum had Asian marketing outlets supplied remotely from California. In 1933, Jersey Standard and Socony-Vacuum mer-ged their interests in the region into a 50-50 joint venture. Standard-Vacuum Oil Co., or &quot;Stanvac,&quot; operated in 50 countries, from East Africa to New Zealand, before it was dissolved in 1962.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Mobil Chemical Company was established in 1950. As of 1999, its principal products included basic olefins and aromatics, ethylene glycol and polyethylene. The company produced synthetic lubricant base stocks as well as lubricant additives, pro-pylene packaging films and catalysts. Exxon Chemical Company (first named Enjay Chemicals) became a worldwide orga-nization in 1965 and in 1999 was a major producer and marketer of olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene along with specialty lines such as elastomers, plasticizers, solvents, process fluids, oxo alcohols and adhesive resins. The com-pany was an industry leader in metallocene catalyst technology to make unique polymers with improved performance.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In 1955, Socony-Vacuum became Socony Mobil Oil Co. and in 1966 simply Mobil Oil Corp. A decade later, the newly incor-porated Mobil Corporation absorbed Mobil Oil as a wholly owned subsidiary. Jersey Standard changed its name to Exxon Corporation in 1972 and established Exxon as a trademark throughout the United States. In other parts of the world, Exxon and its affiliated companies continued to use its Esso trademark.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska and spilled more than 11 million gallons (42,000 m&sup3;) of crude oil. The Exxon Valdez oil spill was the second largest in U.S. history, and in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez incident, the U.S. Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. An initial award of $5 billion USD puniti-ve was reduced to $507.5 million by the US Supreme Court in June 2008, and distributions of this award have commenced.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In 1998, Exxon and Mobil signed a US$73.7 billion definitive agreement to merge and form a new company called Exxon Mobil Corporation, the largest company on the planet. After shareholder and regulatory approvals, the merger was com-pleted on November 30, 1999. The merger of Exxon and Mobil was unique in American history because it reunited the two largest companies of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey/Exxon and Standard Oil Company of New York/Mobil, which had been forcibly separated by government order nearly a century earlier. This reun-ion resulted in the largest merger in US corporate history.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In 2000, ExxonMobil sold a refinery in Benicia, California and 340 Exxon-branded stations to Valero Energy Corporation, as part of an FTC-mandated divestiture of California assets. ExxonMobil continues to supply petroleum products to over 700 Mobil-branded retail outlets in California.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In 2005, ExxonMobil's stock price surged in parallel with rising oil prices, surpassing General Electric as the largest corpo-ration in the world in terms of market capitalization. At the end of 2005, it reported record profits of US $36 billion in annual income, up 42% from the previous year (the overall annual income was an all-time record for annual income by any busi-ness, and included $10 billion in the third quarter alone, also an all-time record income for a single quarter by any business). The company and the American Petroleum Institute (the oil and chemical industry's lobbying organization) put these profits in context by comparing oil industry profits to those of other large industries such as pharmaceuticals and banking.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">On June 12, 2008, ExxonMobil announced that it was exiting the retail fuel business, citing the increasing difficulty to run gas stations under rising crude oil costs. The multi-year process will gradually phase the corporation out of the direct market, and will affect 820 company-owned stations and approximately 1,400 other stations operated by dealers distributing across the United States. The sale won't result in the disappearance of Exxon and Mobil branded stations; the new owners will con-tinue to sell ExxonMobil gasoline and license the appropriate names from ExxonMobil, who'll in turn get compensated for use of the brand. </FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In 2005, ExxonMobil surpassed Wal-Mart as the world's largest publicly held corporation when measured by revenue, although Wal-Mart remained the largest by number of employees.

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In 2006, Wal-Mart recaptured the lead with revenues of $348.7 billion against ExxonMobil's $335.1. ExxonMobil continued to lead the world in both profits ($39.5 billion in 2006) and market value ($460.43 billion).</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In 2007, ExxonMobil had a record net income of $40.61 billion on $404.552 of revenue, an increase largely due to escalating oil prices as their actual oil equivalent production decreased by 1%, in part due to expropriation of their Venezuelan assets by the Chavez government.</FONT></div>

Based on year 2000 data, ExxonMobil was ranked sixth on the Toxic 100 list of US corporate air polluters by Political Economy Research Institute (PERI). In 2005, ExxonMobil had committed less than 1% of their profits towards researching alternative energy,less than other leading oil companies. </FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The March 24, 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill resulted in the discharge of approximately 11 million gallons of oil (240,000 bar-rels) into Prince William Sound, oiling of the remote Alaskan coastline. The State of Alaska's Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council stated that the spill &quot;is widely considered the number one spill worldwide in terms of damage to the environment&quot;, Exxon later removed the name &quot;Exxon&quot; from its tanker shipping subsidiary, which it renamed &quot;SeaRiver Maritime.&quot; The rena-med subsidiary, though wholly Exxon-controlled, has a separate corporate charter and board of directors, and the former Ex-xon Valdez's now the SeaRiver Mediterranean. The renamed tanker's legally owned by a small, stand-alone company, which would've minimal ability to pay out on claims in the event of a further accident.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">After a trial, a jury ordered Exxon to pay $5 billion in punitive damages, though an appeals court reduced that amount by half. Exxon appealed further, and on June 25, 2008, the United States Supreme Court lowered the amount to $500 million.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In 2009, Exxon still uses more single-hull tankers than the rest of the largest ten oil companies combined, including the Val-dez's sister ship, the SeaRiver Long Beach. </FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">A study of the spill released by the US Environmental Protection Agency in September 2007 reported that the spill consists of approximately 17 to 30 million gallons of petroleum products from the mid 1800's to the mid 1900's. The largest portion of these operations were by ExxonMobil or its predecessors. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez oil spill was approximately 11 million gallons. </FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Scientists and environmental groups voice concern that the Sakhalin-I oil and gas project in the Russian Far East, operated by an ExxonMobil subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), threatens the critically endangered western gray whale popu-lation. In February, 2009, independent scientists, convened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature issued an urgent call for a &quot;...moratorium on all industrial activities, both maritime and terrestrial, that've the potential to disturb gray whales in summer and autumn on and near their main feeding areas&quot; following a sharp decline in observed whales in the main feeding area in 2008, adjacent to ENL's project area. The scientists also harshly criticized ENL’s unwillingness to coo-perate with the scientific panel process, which “certainly impedes the cause of western gray whale conservation.” </FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">ExxonMobil has drawn criticism for funding organizations critical of the Kyoto Protocol and skeptical of the scientific opinion that global warming's caused by the burning of fossil fuels. According to Mother Jones Magazine, the company was a mem-ber of one of the first such skeptic groups, the Global Climate Coalition, founded in 1989. According to The Guardian, Exxon-Mobil has funded, among other groups skeptical of global warming, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, George C. Marshall Institute, Heartland Institute, Congress on Racial Equality, TechCentralStation.com, and International Policy Network. ExxonMobil's support for these organizations has drawn criticism from the Royal Society, the academy of sciences of the United Kingdom. The Union of Concerned Scientists released a report in 2007 accusing ExxonMobil of spending $16 million, between 1998 and 2005, towards 43 advocacy organizations which dispute the impact of global warming. The report argued that ExxonMobil used disinformation tactics similar to those used by the tobacco industry in its denials of the link between lung cancer and smoking, saying that the company used &quot;many of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scien-tific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue.&quot;}} </FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">ExxonMobil has been reported as having plans to invest up to US$100m over a ten year period in Stanford University's Glo-bal Climate and Energy Project.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In August 2006, the Wall Street Journal revealed that a YouTube video Al Gore, titled Al Gore's Penguin Army, appeared to be astroturfing by DCI Group, a Washington PR firm with ties to ExxonMobil as well as the Republican Party.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In January 2007, the company appeared to change its position, when vice president for public affairs Kenneth Cohen said &quot;we know enough now—or, society knows enough now—that the risk's serious and action should be taken.&quot; Cohen stated that, as of 2006, ExxonMobil had ceased funding of the Competitive Enterprise Institute and &quot;'five or six' similar groups&quot;. While the company didn't publicly state which the other similar groups were, a May 2007 report by Greenpeace does list the five groups it stopped funding as well as a list of 41 other climate skeptic groups which are still receiving ExxonMobil funds.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">On February 13, 2007, ExxonMobil CEO Rex W. Tillerson acknowledged that the planet was warming while carbon dioxide levels were increasing, but in the same speech gave an unqualified defense of the oil industry and predicted that hydro-carbons would dominate the world’s transportation as energy demand grows by an expected 40 percent by 2030. Tillerson stated that there's no significant alternative to oil in coming decades, and that ExxonMobil would continue to make petroleum and natural gas its primary products, saying: &quot;I'm no expert on biofuels. I don't know much about farming and I don't know much about moonshine. ... There's really nothing ExxonMobil can bring to that whole biofuels issue. We don't see a direct role for ourselves with today's technology.&quot;</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">A survey carried out by the UK's Royal Society found that in 2005 ExxonMobil distributed $2.9m to 39 groups that the society said &quot;misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence&quot;. </FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">ExxonMobil has been harshly criticized by major environmental advocacy groups among which are Greenpeace. In 2003, Greenpeace listed Exxon as #1 Climate Criminal. Exxon's alleged crimes include the sabotage of efforts to deal with climate change, the fraudulent manipulation of peer reviewed scientific studies and organizations, misleading and outright lying to the population of the USA, its government officials and the global community in general. It's also been accused of fomenting so called junk science in order to deny climate change and support the views of climate sceptics, among other actions. </FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Investigative reporting by Forbes Magazine raised questions about ExxonMobil's dealings with the leaders of oil-rich nations. ExxonMobil controls concessions covering 11 million acres (44,500 km&sup2;) off the coast of Angola that hold an estimated 7.5 billion barrels (1.2 km&sup3;) of crude.

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In March 2003, James Giffen of the Mercator Corporation was indicted, accused of bribing President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan with $78 million to help ExxonMobil win a 25 percent share of the Tengiz oilfield, the third largest in the world. On April 2, 2003, former-Mobil executive J. Bryan Williams was indicted on tax charges relating to this same transaction. The case's the largest under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This series of events's depicted in the film Syriana.</FONT></div>
<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In a U.S. Department of Justice release dated September 18, 2003, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced that J. Bryan Williams, a former senior executive of Mobil Oil Corporation, had been sentenced to three years and ten months in prison on charges of evading income taxes on more than $7 million in unreported income, &quot;inclu-ding a $2 million kickback he received in connection with Mobil's oil business in Kazakhstan.&quot; According to documents filed with the court, Williams' unreported income included millions of dollars in kickbacks from governments, persons, and other entities with whom Williams conducted business while employed by Mobil. In addition to his sentence, Williams must pay a fine of $25,000 and more than $3.5 million in restitution to the IRS, in addition to penalties and interest. </FONT></div>

<div><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFCC" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">ExxonMobil's the target of human rights activists for actions taken by the corporation in the Indonesian territory of Aceh. In June 2001 a lawsuit against ExxonMobil was filed in the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia under the Alien Tort Claims Act. The suit alleges that the ExxonMobil knowingly assisted human rights violations, including torture, murder and rape, by employing and providing material support to Indonesian military forces, who committed the alleged offenses during civil unrest in Aceh. Human rights complaints involving Exxon's (Exxon and Mobil hadn't yet merged) relationship with the Indonesian military first arose in 1992; the company denies these accusations and has filed a motion to dismiss the suit, which as of 2006's still pending.</FONT></div>
