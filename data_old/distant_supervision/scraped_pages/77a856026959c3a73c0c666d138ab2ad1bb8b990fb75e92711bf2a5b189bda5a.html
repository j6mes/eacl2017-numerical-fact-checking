      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;Located in Southeastern Arizona, Cross Spear Marble, Inc. (CSM)
          is located near the Chiricaua National Monument and the Fort Bowie
          National  Historic Site on privately owned ranch. The working cattle
          ranch has been  in operation since the 1880's. The quarry spans over
          50 acres and contains  five distinct veins of various colored marble
          and limestone. Once the  marble and limestone are extracted from the
          quarry, CSM is capable of  producing various sizes of rock for multiple
          customer needs.</p>
        <p>&quot;The Cross Spear Mine is an excellent deposit of marble and marbleized
          limestone along the western foothills of the historic Chiricahua mountains
          of southeastern Arizona.</p>
        <p>&quot;The deposit is extensive and contains several colors. It is
          on  land owned by the Riggs family, long time ranchers in Willcox,
          Arizona.</p>
        <p>&quot;In the days when Apache Indians roamed the area, it is said
          that  the famed Apache Chief, Cochise, stood on a mountain just above
          where  the mine is located, noted the two canyons below crossed and
          he said they  resembled a &quot;cross spear.&quot; The mining venture
          took its name  from this and became Cross Spear Marble, Inc.</p>
        <p>&quot;The deposit is mined by simple open pit methods. The marble
          is  crushed and then sized with screens. Sizes range from boulders
          to nearly  sand, depending upon what the customer wants. Several colors
          are available:  white, natural red, gray, green, and black.</p>
        <p>&quot;A principle application of Cross Spear Marble products is stone
          for decorative landscaping. Another application is for compacted road
          surfacing. Future products include marble slabs, tile, terrazzo, and
          other  high-end marble applications.&quot;      </p>

        <p>The writer describes the area as being on public land as &ldquo;a cluster of  small, abandoned marble quarries on the north slope of the Dragoon Mountains.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He gives directions how to get to the  abandoned quarries.)&nbsp; He describes the  history of the quarries as:&nbsp; </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;History: In 1909 marble was discovered in a canyon  on the north slope of the Dragoon Mountains, just a few miles from the town of  Dragoon. The claim, situated atop a slice of metamorphosed Mississippian  Escabrosa Limestone, did not produce until 1953. Small scale mining by  Ligier-Arizona Marble Quarries, Inc, and its successor, Dragoon Marble  Quarries, continued as late as 1981, mostly producing marble for landscaping  purposes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>      He describes what is left of the marble quarries as  first finding a small white pit.&nbsp; Later  in the hike he saw a &ldquo;loading structure&rdquo; and even further on he describes: &nbsp;&ldquo;There are several pits here, where sparkling  snow white and pale grey marble was removed from the earth.&rdquo;</p>
